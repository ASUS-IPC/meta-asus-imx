These files are required to flash the Yocto Linux OS to an attached 
PE100A / IMX8P-IM-A using fastboot.

Note:Â Do not power the board or connect any cables until instructed to do so.

The factory settings only includes a U-Boot bootloader for the fastboot mode
and does not include a system.

Before you begin the flashing procedure, please ensure of the following:
- The board is completely powered off.
- The boot mode switches are set to eMMC mode.
  (Switch 1 : Switch 2 : Switch 3 : Switch 4) = (ON : OFF : OFF : ON)

1. Connect the USB Type-C cable to the USB Type-C ports on the board and your
   host computer.
2. Power on the board and the board should automatically boots into the
   fastboot mode.
3. Make sure the driver is installed if the host computer is equipped with
   Windows.
4. Run the `flashall.cmd` script for Windows or `flashall.sh` for Linux in this
   directory.

To reflash the system image, please launch weston-terminal on the board and
run `sudo reboot-bootloader` to reboot the board into the fastboot mode.
Then, follow the step 4 above.

If you get unlucky and you can't even boot your board into the fastboot mode,
then you can recover the system by booting into the serial download mode and then
reflash the board from your host computer as follows.

1. Power off the board and change the boot mode switches to serial download mode
  (Switch 1 : Switch 2 : Switch 3 : Switch 4) = (OFF : ON : OFF : ON)
2. Connect the USB Type-C cable to the USB Type-C ports on the board and your
   host computer.
3. Power on the board and the board should automatically boots into the
   serial download mode.
4. Make sure the driver is installed if the host computer is equipped with
   Windows.
5. Run the `flashall.cmd` script for Windows or `flashall.sh` for Linux in this
   directory.
6. When flashing is complete, your board will not boot up, because it stay in 
   serial download mode. So please power off the board and reset the boot mode
   switch to eMMC mode then power on the board.
